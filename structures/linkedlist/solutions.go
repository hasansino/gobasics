// https://afteracademy.com/problems/reverse-linked-list
// Reverse linked list
// Write a program to reverse a singly linked list.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list
// Middle of the Linked List
// Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head,
// write a program to return a middle node of linked list.
// If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes,
// we need to print second middle element.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list
// Odd even linked List
// Given a singly linked list, write a program to group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes.
// Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
// You should try to do it in place.
// The program should run in O(n) time complexity.
// The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
// The first node is considered odd, the second node even, and so on.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list
// Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
// Given a sorted linked list, write a program to delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/sort-list-merge-sort
// Sort List - Merge Sort
// Sort a linked list using Merge Sort.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/check-if-a-singly-linked-list-is-palindrome
// Check if a singly linked list is palindrome
// Given a singly linked list head, write a program to determine if its a palindrome.
// The linked list consists of digits from 0-9.
// Try doing this without using extra space.
// Return 1 if its a palindrome, else 0.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/detect-and-remove-loop-in-a-linked-list
// Detect and Remove Loop in a Linked List
// You are given the head of a linked list which probably contains a loop.
// If the list contains a loop, you need to find the last node of the list
// which points to one of its previous nodes to create a loop and make it
// point to NULL, thereby removing the loop.

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/sort-a-linked-list-using-insertion-sort
// Sort a linked list using insertion sort
// You are given a singly linked list, write a program to sort it using insertion sort.
// Return the head of the sorted linked list
// Try to solve the problem using in-place algorithm(O(1) space).

// https://afteracademy.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-list-end
// Remove Nth Node from List End
// You are given a linked list, write a program to remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return the head of the linked list.
// It is guaranteed that n â‰¤ length of linked list
// Try to do this in one iteration.
